## Hi there 👋

😄 So, i just thought, since i am working as an IT apprentice for the first time of my life in a real campany Here in Germany, i will just share what i am learning there.
 🌱 i am learning VueJs, primevue and NuxtJx. the 20.10.2025, i created a simple campus event web App where users can add event for the campus. Now i am migrating an expressJs code to NuxtJs. it's so fun.
